The GtkD library and included works are provided under the terms of the
GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) version 3, or (at your option)
any later version, with the following exceptions:

1. Modifications to any of the works included within the GtkD library to support a specific 
platform or application do not constitute a modified or derivative work.

2. Static linking of applications or any other source to the GtkD library does not constitute a 
modified or derivative work and does not require the author(s) to provide source code for said 
work, use the shared GtkD libraries, or link their applications against a user-supplied version 
of GtkD. If you link applications to a modified version of GtkD, then the changes to GtkD must be 
provided under the terms of the LGPL.

3. You do not have to provide a copy of the GtkD license with applications that are linked to the 
GtkD library, nor do you have to identify GtkD's license in your application as required by the 
LGPL. However, applications must still identify their use of GtkD. The following example statement 
can be included in the application or it's documentation to satisfy this requirement:

[application] is based in part on works of the GtkD project (http://gtkd.org).

The above exceptions are temporary and are subject to change at any time.
