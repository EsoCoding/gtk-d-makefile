## Install 
At this moment only system install is supoorted which will be installed using a makefile. So there is not yet support for dub and meson, tough this will soon be implemented. In order to be able to generate and install Gtk-d, its neccesarly to have the GIR files for the Library's. You can get them by installing the dev version of all the packages. For shared library simply use the usual:
````
make shared-lib
````
for static library'Å› type
````
make static-lib
````
And to finalize the install and copy the files to the system:
````
make install
````

## Additional info

I have included gir-to-d in compile process. To Link the gtk functions with the runtime linker use and generate files for shared-lib:
````
make generate-runtime using linker
````
and for static files choose:
````
make generate-compiletime
````


### Windows libraries
You can get required dll form MSYS2 project`s repo :)
