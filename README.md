# GTK-D

#### GTK-d is the continuation of [GtkD](https://gtkd.org/) which no longer seems to be under active development. ####

## Description

GTK-d is a DLang wrapper for Gtk-4 and some other Gtk library's like Adwaita, Shumate. You can use all libraries together or take one you need thanks to DUB submodules.

## Contributing
Anyone is free to help and contribute wether this is trough posting issues, adding examples, adding library's or perhaps you have published some helpfull tutorials, please feel free to commit and support the progress in anyway you can. If you want to make contact, you can send me a email at info@gtk-d.com or find me in [gtk-d](https://matrix.to/#/#gtkd:matrix.org) channel of the matrix chat server.

## Installation
At the moment you can use dub to install and build the repository and for those who prefer to install gtk-d to their system instead of the .dub folder, there is a another gtk-d repo that has a makefile that generaties pkg-config and installs gtk-d to the folders you would normally install programs to.

## Install 
At this moment only system install is supoorted which will be installed using a makefile. So there is not yet support for dub and meson, tough this will soon be implemented. In order to be able to generate and install Gtk-d, its neccesarly to have the GIR files for the Library's. You can get them by installing the dev version of all the packages. For shared library simply use the usual:
````
make shared-lib
````
for static library'Å› type
````
make static-lib
````
And to finalize the install and copy the files to the system:
````
make install
````

## Additional info

To generate your own gtk bindings you need to install gir-to-d, 
To genereate static linking you have to install gir-to-d and run 
````
girtod --use-runtime-linker -i sources/ -o generated
````
Or for shared linking
````
girtod -i sources/ -o generated

````
and for static files choose:
````
make generate-compiletime
````


### Windows libraries
You can get required dll form MSYS2 project`s repo :)
